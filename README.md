A Steerable Pyramid Decomposition of 3D images along "3D Steerable Pyramid based on conic filters"
Celine A. Delle Luche, Florence Denis and Atilla Baskurt. 

This is an inversible decomposition of 3D images into band-pass oriented components. Currently, the following regularly oriented conic filters are implemented: octahedral (3 directions), cubic (4 directions), icosahedral (6 directions), rhombic dodecahedral (7 directions) dodecahedral (10 directions), and rhombic triacontahedron (16 directions). Any number of spatial frequency bands can be used. The figure below illustrates decomposition of a sample 3D image (the central slice is shown) into 4 spatial bands and 4 orientation bands of the cubic symmetry.
